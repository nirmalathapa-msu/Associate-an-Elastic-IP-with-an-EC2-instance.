# What is elastic ip in AWSÂ¶
In AWS (Amazon Web Services), an Elastic IP (EIP) is a static public IPv4 address that you can allocate to your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and some load balancers. The term "elastic" refers to the fact that you can easily associate and disassociate the IP address with your instances and other resources, making it flexible and portable.

When you launch a new EC2 instance in AWS, it is assigned a dynamic public IP address by default. However, this dynamic IP address can change whenever you stop and start the instance, or if there's any interruption in the underlying infrastructure.

On the other hand, an Elastic IP address remains associated with your AWS account until you explicitly release it. This makes it useful for scenarios where you need a consistent, public IP address for your resources, such as hosting a website, setting up a VPN, or accessing resources from the internet.

By using an Elastic IP, you can:

Associate a persistent public IP address with your instance or other resources, ensuring that the address remains the same even after instance stop/start cycles.
Reserve an IP address in your AWS account, which can be useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that the IP address remains unchanged even if the instance is terminated and later relaunched.
Easily remap the Elastic IP to different instances or resources within the same AWS account, providing a level of flexibility for your architecture.
Also you might want server's IP address static if it calls 3rd party APIs and you need to whitelist its IP address. Elastic IP address will be used when server is making outgoing connections.
